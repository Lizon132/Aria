    "date_and_time": "I would prefer to travel on the weekend of the 20th to 22nd of next month, ideally departing on Friday evening or any time on Saturday. I'm somewhat flexible with these times; I could leave a day earlier or return a day later if it significantly reduces the cost or improves the travel options. However, I cannot travel on weekdays due to work commitments.",
    "travel_duration": "I prefer the quickest travel option available because long journeys tend to tire me out. However, if there's a significant cost difference, I'm willing to consider a longer duration. Ideally, the total travel time should not exceed 8 hours.",
    "price_sensitivity": "Price is a crucial factor for me; I'm looking for the most cost-effective options available within a reasonable comfort level. My budget is tight for this trip, so I'd appreciate any deals or suggestions that could lower the cost without compromising too much on travel quality."
